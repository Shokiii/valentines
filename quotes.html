            <p>“I love you without knowing how, or when, or from where. I love you simply, without problems or pride: I love you in this way because I do not know any other way of loving but this, in which there is no I or you, so intimate that your hand upon my chest is my hand, so intimate that when I fall asleep your eyes close.”
                ― Pablo Neruda, 100 Love Sonnets</p>

            <p>“When we love, we always strive to become better than we are. When we strive to become better than we are, everything around us becomes better too.”

            <p>“Who was I before?<br>I don't remember.<br>Nor do I want to<br> remember a time without you.<br><br>Where was I before? I don't remember.<br>I just knew<br> when I found you<br> I had come home.</p>
            <p class="subtitle">Especially the "I had come home" part resonated with me. You're so loving and caring and sweet and kind. When we first met i truly felt at home like i never felt before.<br> Also it's not rly related to the poem itself, but like i believe "home" is a meaningful word when thinking about our future. What is really important to me is that our children will feel at home with us, and you really are the perfect girlfriend and wife and future mother of our children for that.</p>

            <p>“So it's not gonna be easy. It's going to be really hard; we're gonna have to work at this everyday, but I want to do that because I want you. I want all of you, forever, everyday. You and me... everyday.”

            <p>You are my sun, my guiding light,<br>
                Every moment with you feels so right.<br>
                With your presence, you brighten up my day,<br>
                And in your warmth, I always want to stay.<br>
                Your love is like sunshine, it warms me inside,<br>
                Despite all the dark in life, you're my light, <br>
                you push the darkness aside.<br>
                And I pray that you see the same in me,<br>
                To be your sun and your sunshine is what i aspire to be<br>
                When the sky is Grey and clouds drift above,<br>
                I want to be the sunray that shines through<br>
                A sunray of happiness and love<br>
                Shining only for you - guess by who(kinda embarrassing ngl)</p>
